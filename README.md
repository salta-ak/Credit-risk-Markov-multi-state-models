# Credit-risk-Markov-multi-state-models
The Aalen–Johansen estimator is a matrix version of the Kaplan–Meier estimator, and it can be used to estimate the transition probability matrix of a Markov process with a finite number of states. The estimator is first presented for the competing risks model and the Markov illness‐death model for a chronic disease
